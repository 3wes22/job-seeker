# Project Summary: Job Platform Microservices

This document provides an overview of the current state of the Job Platform microservices project, summarizing the implemented features, current architecture, and planned future phases.

## Current State of the Project

The Job Platform is being developed as a set of interconnected microservices, each responsible for a specific domain. The backend services are built using Django and Django REST Framework, communicating primarily via REST APIs and asynchronously through Kafka for event-driven interactions.

Currently, the core services are:
- **User Service**: Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles (job seeker, employer, admin).
- **Job Service**: Manages job postings, companies, categories, and skills.
- **Application Service**: Handles job applications and interviews.
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes analytics events.
- **Notification Service**: Manages and sends notifications to users.
- **Search Service**: Provides full-text search capabilities across entities.

The recent focus has been on integrating Kafka for inter-service communication, ensuring robust event publishing and consumption.

## Summary of Implemented Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Management**: User registration, login, profile management, and user listing.
- **Job Management**: Creation, listing, detail viewing, updating, and soft-deletion of job postings. Management of companies, job categories, and skills.
- **Application Management**: Creation, listing, detail viewing, updating, and soft-deletion of job applications. Interview scheduling and tracking.
- **Basic Analytics**: Recording of analytics events, user, job, and platform specific metrics.
- **Basic Notifications**: Notification templates, individual notifications, and user preferences.
- **Basic Search**: Full-text search across entities, search history, and search analytics.

### Kafka Integration
- **Event Publishing**: Services can publish domain-specific events (e.g., `UserCreatedEvent`, `JobCreatedEvent`, `CompanyCreatedEvent`) to Kafka topics.
- **Event Consumption**: Services are set up to consume relevant events from Kafka topics, enabling asynchronous updates and reactions across the platform.
- **Shared Utilities**: A `shared` Python package contains common event definitions (`events.py`) and Kafka utility classes (`kafka_utils.py`) for consistent event handling across microservices.
- **Configuration**: Kafka broker addresses, group IDs, and topic names are configurable via environment variables in each service's `settings.py`.

## Overview of Current Project Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture with a shared Kafka message broker for asynchronous communication.

- **Services**: Each service (User, Job, Application, Analytics, Notification, Search) is an independent Django application with its own database.
- **API Gateway (Planned)**: An API Gateway will sit in front of the services to handle routing, authentication, and potentially rate limiting. (Not yet implemented, but implied by service structure).
- **Kafka**: Acts as the central nervous system for inter-service communication, enabling event-driven patterns. Events are defined in a shared module to ensure consistency.
- **Databases**: Each service uses PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local development fallback) for its persistent data storage, maintaining data isolation.
- **Shared Module**: A `backend/shared` directory contains common Python utilities, such as Kafka event definitions and Kafka producer/consumer wrappers, to reduce code duplication and enforce consistency. This module is added to the Python path of each service.

## Planned Next Phases of the Project

1.  **Complete Kafka Integration for All Services**:
    - Implement event consumers and publishers for Analytics, Application, Notification, and Search services, similar to the User and Job services.
    - Define necessary event types for these services in `shared/events.py`.

2.  **Implement Comprehensive Event Handling Logic**:
    - Develop the business logic within each service's Kafka consumers to react to events from other services (e.g., Job Service updating `UserProfileCache` on `UserUpdatedEvent`, Search Service updating its index on `JobCreatedEvent`).

3.  **API Gateway Implementation**:
    - Set up an API Gateway (e.g., using Django REST Framework or a dedicated gateway like Kong/Ocelot) to centralize API access, authentication, and routing.

4.  **Frontend Development**:
    - Develop client applications (web, mobile) that interact with the API Gateway to provide the user interface for the job platform.

5.  **Deployment and Infrastructure Automation**:
    - Containerize all services using Docker.
    - Orchestrate deployment using Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes for production.
    - Set up a production-ready Kafka cluster.

6.  **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack).
    - Set up monitoring and alerting for service health and performance.

7.  **Advanced Features**:
    - Real-time notifications using WebSockets.
    - Recommendation engine for jobs/candidates.
    - Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards.
    - Payment integration for premium features.

The current work has laid a solid foundation for the Kafka integration, making the project ready to scale and expand its event-driven capabilities across all microservices.
