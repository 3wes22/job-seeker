## ‚úÖ Authentication Requirements

- **Public Endpoints:** `/api/users/register/`, `/api/users/login/`, `/api/jobs/` (GET)
- **Authenticated Endpoints:** All other endpoints require JWT token in Authorization header
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Job Seekers: Can apply for jobs, view their applications
  - Employers: Can create jobs, view applications for their jobs, update application status

## üöÄ Flutter Integration Notes

1. **Base URL:** Use `http://localhost:8000` for all API calls
2. **CORS:** Headers are configured for cross-origin requests
3. **Authentication:** Store JWT token and include in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
4. **Error Handling:** 
   - 401: Authentication required/invalid
   - 403: Insufficient permissions
   - 404: Resource not found
   - 400: Bad request/validation errors

## üìä Database Status

All services are running with test data intact:
- Users: Registration and login functional
- Jobs: Sample jobs available for browsing
